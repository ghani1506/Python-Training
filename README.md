# Python Training for Academic Staff

Welcome to the Python Training Repository! This resource is designed to help academic staff progress through three levels of Python proficiency: **Emerging (Basic)**, **Developing (Intermediate)**, and **Secure (Expert)**. Each level includes topics, learning outcomes, practice exercises, and additional resources to guide you through your Python learning journey.

## Overview

This repository contains Python training materials tailored for academic staff at different proficiency levels. The training is structured into three sections:

- **Emerging (Basic):** For beginners with little to no experience in Python.
- **Developing (Intermediate):** For those with some experience looking to deepen their skills.
- **Secure (Expert):** For proficient users aiming to master advanced Python topics.

Each section is designed to build on the previous one, so it's recommended to start from the beginning and progress sequentially.

## Emerging (Basic)

### Topics Covered

1. Create and Execute Your First Cell
2. Identify Types of Cells
3. Use `print()` Function
4. Use `type()` Function to Identify Data Type
5. Create Variables
6. Basic Applications

## Developing (Intermediate)

### Topics Covered

1. Create a List
2. Using `len()` Function
3. List Indexing and Modifications
4. Commenting Codes
5. Importing Python Libraries
6. Identify and Debug Errors
7. Code Using Control Flow (`if`, `for` Loop, `while` Loop)

## Secure (Expert)

### Topics Covered

1. Code Using Basic Functions
2. Perform Data Handling
3. Apply Your Skills in Data Visualization and Analysis

### Learning Outcomes

- Develop and use custom functions to organize and simplify code.
- Perform advanced data handling, including reading, processing, and analyzing data.
- Apply Python skills in data visualization and analysis to generate meaningful insights from data.

### Practice Exercises

- Each section will be given tasks for practice purposes
- Mentimeter quiz is included every end of each material.

### Resources

- All resources links are included in the training materials in markdown cells.
